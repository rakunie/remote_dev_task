# Remote Dev Pre-Interview Task

## Hi there :)
It's great to see you landing on this page. It means we, at rakun, believe in your potential and want to assess your skills and see if we are a perfect match to work together on our exciting projects.

### Your Task

We would like you to build a contact form that will collect the following data:

Name:
Last Name:
Email: 
Phone:
Photo: 

And store it to [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) `it's free to use`

Don't worry about the designs, that's not what we want to see from you. 
However we expect to see a form functionality that could be used as is for a client's website.

### Good to have:
- It would be great to see you implement the solution using VueJS, as it's our framework of choice for most of our projects.

### Submision:

You can make a private repo share it with us @ larry@rakun.ie
or ZIP your files and send them to info@rakun.ie

If you have any questions you can reach out @ larry@rakun.ie
